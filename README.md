# Processing Skeleton

Designed to be a basic Processing Skeleton app - clone it and add to it.

* Maven based - use a proper ide like NetBeans
* P3D - accelerated graphics
* Peasycam - spin things with the mouse

Unfortunately peasycam isn't available via Maven Central so i've included instructions on how to
download it and install it to your local repo.
